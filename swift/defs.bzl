"""Project Swift build rules.

Wraps rules_swift's `swift_binary` to bundle the hermetic Swift runtime on Linux.

The hermetic Swift toolchain (configured via the `swift` bzlmod extension in
//MODULE.bazel) downloads a standalone toolchain from swift.org and sets each
binary's RUNPATH to the toolchain's `lib/swift/<os>` dir -- but it does NOT stage
the runtime `.so`s (libswiftCore.so, libswiftSwiftOnoneSupport.so, ...) into the
binary's runfiles. As a result a bare `bazel run` / `bazel test` of a swift_binary
fails to load the Swift runtime. This wrapper adds the toolchain files as a data
dependency on Linux so the runtime is present in runfiles. macOS resolves the
runtime through Xcode, so no data dep is added there.

Remove this wrapper (and the config_settings in //swift:BUILD) once rules_swift
stages the runtime libraries automatically.
