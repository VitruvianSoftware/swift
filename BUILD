# One-command BUILD/source hygiene. Regenerates BUILD files (gazelle), refreshes
# the Python deps manifest (when Python is enabled), then formats everything
# (//tools/format bundles buildifier + every per-language formatter; it ships
# only when the `lint` feature is on). Sequential so the formatter sees gazelle's
# freshly written BUILD files. Run `bazel run //:tidy`; the Tidy Check CI job
# fails a PR when running this would change anything.
